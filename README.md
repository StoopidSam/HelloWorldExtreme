# HelloWorldSupreme

### **`pip install helloworldsupreme`**

Welcome to HelloWorldSupreme, a simple, *yet powerful* Python library with a **HUGE** featureset. 

Are you tired of writing those same old lines of code? Well, fear not! This module is for you!

## Functions

This library has a basic function that will help you out loads when writing code.

### sayhello
```
sayhello(name=None, withemoji=None)
```
This has 2 parameters, `name` and `withemoji`. Example use:
```
import helloworldsupreme as hws

hellomsg = hws.sayhello('StoopidSam', withemoji=True)
print(hellomsg)
```
This will return:
```
Hello, StoopidSam! ðŸŒŽ
```
#### Parameter: `name`
This is a string, and can be left blank to return a simple `Hello, world!` message.

#### Parameter: `withemoji`
This is a bool value (True/False). Leave blank for no emoji to be added on to the end.

## Enjoy!
I hope you enjoy using this code. You can see the license by going to `LICENSE.txt`. Any questions DM me on Discord (StoopidSam#0001) or open an issue.
